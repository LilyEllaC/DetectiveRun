# How to Play
After uncovering the murderer's identity, you begin the chase.
Stay focused: while pursuing him, your colleagues will question you to gather crucial information about what obstacles he is using to block his path.
Crashing into an obstacle will prove the end of the journey.

When a boxed word appears in the screen, this is a colleague asking how many of those objects you have jumped over since the last message.
To reply, enter the number by hovering over the box, typing the number and clicking
If you enter the correct number, the obstacles will slow down slightly and you will be given the temporary ability to fly
If you got the question wrong, obstacles will speed up slightly
